## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions
**1. Why do I need to enter a password when first run?**  
> Because of the new authentication measure introduced in PD 17.1.0, you need to bypass it by quickly switching the system time. A "Privileged Helper" needs to be installed on the system to change the time.  
> If you don't do this, you will need to enter the password every time you start an VM.  

**2. Why does PD Runner start without any windows?**  
>PD Runner is a menu-based application, it only show an icon in the menu bar for use after starting, and there is no main window.  

**3.  Why do I get an warning while running or installing PD Runner?**

```
 sudo bash -c 'rm -rf /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.lihaoyun6.PD-Runner-Helper && launchctl enable system/com.lihaoyun6.PD-Runner-Helper'
